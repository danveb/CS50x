Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: As the number of simulations was smaller it proved to be incorrect as oppossed to with a larger number of simulations to run

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The simulation would be "good enough" after running about 1000 times
