# SQL, structured querying language, is a language for querying databases.
# We can store data in it, update data, delete data, etc.

# Flat-file database
# data stored in a single table represented by a text file, like CSV, Excel; it's the simplest method to read/write files
# Python comes with native support for "csv" files where it can read, write, etc.
import csv

# Relational Databases
# a relational database stores all data in tables with rows and columns
# tables can have relationships, meaning they can relate to different tables

# 4 things we can do in databases (CRUD)
# C -> CREATE
# R -> READ
# U -> UPDATE
# D -> DELETE

# in SQL we can do CRUD as follows:
# CREATE -> INSERT
# READ -> SELECT
# UPDATE -> UPDATE
# DELETE -> DROP
