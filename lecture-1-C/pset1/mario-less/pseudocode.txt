Problem: write a program that accepts a user input, a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive. Return #'s based on user input.

// initialize int height and prompt user for height
// if height is < 1 or > 8 we go back to user prompt; achieve with do...while loop
// for loop: iterate from 1 <= 8; i++
// keep printing #
// add a new line
